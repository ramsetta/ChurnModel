Project Goal
The goal of this project is to use data from Kaggle.com about customer churn with a fake data set made by IBM. I will use a logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models to determine what variables are important to churn and what models help predict churn. From there, I will use a cost savings model to determine an amount the company will save if a model is implemented to predict churn.

#
Project Overview
The data set was created by IBM with the intention of creating models with regards to customer churn. The data is from a made up company called, 'Telcoo', which offers services such as internet and tv and contains 7,043 customers' information with 21 different variables (including churn).
