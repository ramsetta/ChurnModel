## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to use data from Kaggle.com about customer churn with a fake data set made by IBM. I will use a logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models to determine what variables are important to churn and what models help predict churn. From there, I will use a cost savings model to determine an amount the company will save if a model is implemented to predict churn.

## Project Overview
The data set was created by IBM with the intention of creating models with regards to customer churn. The data is from a made up company called, 'Telcoo', which offers services such as internet and tv and contains 7,043 customers' information with 21 different variables (including churn). The data allows for various machine learning models to be run and includes opportunites to explore various phases of the data science lifecycle such as data cleaning and feature engineering.
