## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to construct a predictive model that effectively predicts customer churn and provide actionable recommendations and insights based on significant variables and findings from the data. Various machine learning models and techniques were utilized including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest as well as k-fold cross-validation and pruning. Lastly, I wanted to gather experience following the data science lifecycle that provides an end to end experience from business understanding to visualization and presentation.

## Data Overview
The data set was created by IBM with the intention of creating models with regards to customer churn. The data is from a made up company called, 'Telco', which offers services such as internet and tv and contains 7,043 customer's information with 21 different variables including demograpic and plan specific information. The data allows for various machine learning models to be run and includes opportunites to explore various phases of the data science lifecycle such as data exploration, data cleaning and feature engineering.

## Project Description
The data provided by Telco contains a high churn rate of 27%! The current churn reduction strategy in place by Telco is to spend $50 per customer with retention focused efforts. With this current churn rate, Telco will surely collapse in no time as the attrition rate is just too high. A new and improved business strategy is urgently needed that will be more cost effective and forecast potential churning customers before. The models that I have created achieve exactly this, but Telco can only use one of the machine learning models provided. The code and presentation show various models success as well as one that reduces customer costs by over 40%! Also, from the models, important variables were identified with backing from data exploration that provide Telco with short run focal points to begin reducing churn one variable at a time.

## Machine Learning Models Used
* Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with 10-fold Cross Validation 
* Decision Tree, Pruned Decision Tree
* Random Forest, Random Forest with 10-Fold Cross Validation
